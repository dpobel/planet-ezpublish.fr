- Minor formatting improvement: move time accumulators note inside table
- Allow (end user) to display list of included php files in the debug report
- Improve debug report display: . show measurement unit in table headers, not in rows (makes easier copy and paste in spreadsheets) . align data cells to the right, to make easy visual understanding of data . do not display table headers (in html mode) when table contents are not to be printed . reword table headers to be more understandable by non-core developers . add new table before timing points: the 3 most important resources (time, memory, db) . reword "end" timing point into "script end" to be more in line with "script start" . add note about time accumulators not adding up to 100% . add at bottom total time for debug report printing (remove time taken for template table printing)
- Better measurement of time for debug report: - use time from debug messages in debug report instead of time when debug report is printed
- Better measurement of time for debug report: - start initial time counter before the autoloading mechanism is set up - start/stop accumulators asap in their function calls - allow script to declare and end time before debug is printed - show module start time relative to script start, not at time 0
